# 8-bit platformer (working title)

## Description

In this update of our plataformer we introduced ground and flying enemies, both have a pathfinding implemented and they will chase the player if he gets close to them. The player can kill these enemies by jumping on them or shooting by pressing k. We fixed bugs and problems on the game in addition we added logo and title screen. It's now possible to load two different Maps, change between them with the debug keys or reach the goal flower in the first level. The maps are just placeholder for now to showcase the implemented features.
